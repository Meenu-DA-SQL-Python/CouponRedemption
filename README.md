Welcome to my SQL portfolio! In this project, I explore insights from a Coupon Redemption dataset available on Kaggle. 
As an enthusiast of data analysis, I’ve used SQL to dive deep into the data, crafting queries ranging from intermediate to complex levels. 
The goal was to uncover meaningful insights about coupon usage patterns, customer behaviors, and redemption trends.
By applying various SQL techniques like JOINs, subqueries, aggregate functions, and window functions, I've aimed to answer critical business questions. 
This project not only demonstrates my SQL skills but also reflects my approach to solving real-world data challenges.
Feel free to explore the queries and insights I’ve uncovered, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to discuss any part of the project!
